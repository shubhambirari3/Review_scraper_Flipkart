# Review Scrapper 

## About the Project

The **Review Scrapper** is a Flask-based application designed to scrape reviews from Flipkart.com and provide secure access to the data using session-based authentication. It combines Flask for web development, BeautifulSoup for scraping, and SQLite for data storage.

## Features

- **Flask Framework**: Lightweight web application development.
- **Review Scraping**: Extracts reviews from Flipkart using web scraping techniques.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Secure user access with Flask sessions and password hashing.
- **User Management**: Supports user registration and login.
- **Data Storage**: Stores scraped reviews in a SQLite database.
- **Scalable Design**: Handles moderate data volumes efficiently.

## Flask: How Data is Scraped

The application uses Flask to handle HTTP requests and manage the scraping process. Here's how the data scraping works:

1. **Scraping Libraries**: The project uses libraries like `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to scrape reviews from target platforms.
2. **Endpoints**: Flask routes are defined to trigger the scraping process. For example:
   - `/scrape`: Initiates the scraping process for a specific platform.
3. **Data Storage**: Scraped data is stored in a database (e.g., MongoDB or PostgreSQL) for easy retrieval and analysis.
4. **Error Handling**: Flask handles errors gracefully, ensuring the application remains robust during scraping.

## Authentication

This project uses **session-based authentication**:
- **Mechanism**: User IDs are stored in Flaskâ€™s secure session cookies after login.
- **Security**: Passwords are hashed using `werkzeug.security`, and sessions are protected with a secret key.
- **Implementation**: Custom user loading via a `before_request` hook ensures authenticated access to protected routes.

*Note*: While `Flask-JWT-Extended` is included for potential future enhancements (e.g., API endpoints with JWT), the current implementation relies solely on session-based authentication.



## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
